This file is just to outline the plan for Autonomous mode

1) We should be starting with a sample (not specimen) for the following reasons:
    a) Navigating to the basket, and then to the parking area will be much easier than navigating to the submersible, then to the parking area.
        (Forward to the baskets, backwards to the observation zone vs forward to the submersible, backwards to original position, 90 degrees turn, move to observation zone)
    b) It'll be a lot easier to drop a sample in the top basket for 8 points than a specimen on the top rung for 10
        (Rung is ~1in. diameter, meaning we have 0.5in. margin of error either side, vs 5.5in. w/ 2.75 in. margin of error for the basket.)
        (I may be wrong, but I don't think the rung can be successful without some kind of vision/distance sensor)
    c) Math for the rung will be more complex, basket is simpler
        (For the rung, we'll have to extend the slide above it, then decrease the angle while either retracting the slide, or moving the whole bot. TL;DR, it's going to require trig based on the exact angle of the slide at every given point)
        (For the basket, we can calculate an angle and distance away that put the sample above the basket, then just release the claw.)



Start -> Move forward to basket -> Extend viper slide -> Drop sample -> Retract viper slide -> Move backwards to parking -> Chill

If that can't be done in 30 seconds, I don't know what will
Just put it in park and sip a pina colada ig
